Data:

A presence-absence matrix (PAM) composed of 1573 species of terrestrial vertebrates, on a grid of 711 cells (resolution of 0.5°). This PAM derived from IUCN data and was created by Raul Sierra from CONABIO, Mexico. The original data used were IUCN shapefiles of the terrestrial world vertebrates, and then "clipped" to Mexico.

The data is in two formats: 1) cvs table, and 2) .RData format
